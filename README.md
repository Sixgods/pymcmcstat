# pymcmcstat
Python implementation of Matlab package "mcmcstat"

This code is designed to replicate the functionality of the Matlab routines developed and posted here: http://helios.fmi.fi/~lainema/mcmc/

The user interface is designed to be as similar to the Matlab version as possible, but this implementation has taken advantage of certain data structure concepts more amenable to python.  Documentation for the package can be found here: https://prmiles.wordpress.ncsu.edu/codes/

Example scripts for using this package can be found here: https://github.com/prmiles/pymcmcstat_example_scripts
