# pymcmcstat
Python implementation of Matlab package "mcmcstat"

This code is designed to replicate the functionality of the Matlab routines developed and posted here: http://helios.fmi.fi/~lainema/mcmc/

The user interface is designed to be as similar to the Matlab version as possible, but this implementation has taken advantage of certain data structure concepts more amenable to python.
